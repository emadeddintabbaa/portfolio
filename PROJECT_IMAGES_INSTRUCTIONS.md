# Project Images Instructions

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

I've successfully added all your new projects to your portfolio:

1. **QShot** - Bio QR Creator
2. **100Talks** - Communication Platform  
3. **RADIOlingo** - Language Learning App
4. **CheckApp** - Utility Application
5. **Protocol** - Protocol Management App

All projects are now displayed in your portfolio with:
- Proper descriptions
- Links to both Play Store and App Store
- Placeholder images (currently using the existing chatify.png)

## üì± How to Add Real App Screenshots

To replace the placeholder images with actual app screenshots:

### Step 1: Get Screenshots
Visit each app store link and take screenshots of the app preview images:

- App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qshot-bio-qr-creator/id6587578534

**100Talks:**

### Step 2: Save Images
Save the screenshots with these exact names in the `src/Assets/Projects/` folder:
- `qshot.png`
- `100talks.png`
- `radiolingo.png`
- `checkapp.png`
- `protocol.png`

### Step 3: Replace Placeholders
Simply replace the existing placeholder files in `src/Assets/Projects/` with your actual screenshots.

## üéØ Current Status

Your portfolio now displays all 8 projects:
- 5 new projects (with placeholder images)
- 3 existing projects (Bbrain, Zumi, Forsa)

The React app should be running and you can view your updated portfolio at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìù Notes

- All projects are properly linked to their respective app stores
- The layout is responsive and will work on all devices
- Each project has a detailed description highlighting its features
- The placeholder images will automatically be replaced once you add the real screenshots
